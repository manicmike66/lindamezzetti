<h2>Artist statement</h2>

<p class="h5">My art is greatly influenced by travels and the sheer beauty of nature. I love colour, patterns, occurring in nature as well as man made, and I love textures. In my paintings I enjoy adding texture using a wide variety of things such as sand, fruit and veg sacks, fibres such as string, rope or wool,wood bits, fabric, and even laundry lint! I want the painting to grab someone's attention and have them recognise everyday objects They never thought would be used as art!</p>

<p class="h5">With my sewing ventures, I love to pay attention to fine detail giving the final product a finished, solid look and feel. I love searching every fabric shop I can &nbsp;find for prints that are out of the ordinary , contemporary and fun. I put a lot of thought into complementory colour matching and design for fun and functionality.</p>
<p class="h5">With my silk painting, I want to have colours interact with each other side by side, overlapping and mixing. I like to achieve a unique, free flow design with muliple colour schemes.</p>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<p class="h5"><img class="float-left mr-3 mb-2" alt="A photo of the artist" src="/assets/img/linda_profile_pic.jpg" />I was born in Montreal Canada. I trained as a registered nurse and have worked as such in Montreal, Canada, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA and Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1995 I left nursing to raise my family.</p>

<p class="h5">I started to paint in 1991 while on sabbatical in Belgium with my ex-husband, where I took a simple painting class.  Upon our return to the USA I continued my pursuit of painting under the teutalage of Jane Filer at THE ARTS CENTER in Carrboro, North Carolina on and off for about 10 years.</p>

<p class="h5">I come from a long line of sewers. My maternal grandmother was a seamstress in the window of a large department store in Ottawa, Canada at the turn of the 20th century. My mum used to sew clothes for my sisters and I when we were young and one of my sisters graduated Haute Couturiere school in Montreal, Canada. I sewed most of my daughters' clothes when they were small and continue to sew garments for myself and my children.</p>
<p class="h5">My silk painting all began with a day workshop taken at Jerry's Artorama in Raleigh North Carolina in 2001.</p>
<p class="h5">I have travelled extensively while single and as a family unit mostly in Canada USA Europe and India. I have lived in Canada, USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, England and Australia.</p>

<p class="h5">I speak English, French and Italian.</p>
<p class="h5">I was an active member of <a target="_NEW" href="https://www.artwestcommunitygallery.org.au/">Art West Community Gallery</a> and am now an active member of <a href="https://whitehorsearts.info/staging/">Whitehorse Arts Association</a>.</p>
